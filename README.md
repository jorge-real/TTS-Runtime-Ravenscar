# TTS-Runtime-Ravenscar
Ravenscar implementation at the runtime level of a Time-Triggered scheduler.

Files a-distts.ads and a-distts.adb, inside directory "runtime", provide the specification and body of a (non-standard) generic package Ada.Dispatching.TTS.


In the cutting-edge branch:

 - The "runtime" folder contains the latest version of the modified/added runtime source files.

 - The "utilities" folder contains the (ongoing) implementation of a library of TT utilities.

 - The "examples" folder contains example applications for thre STM34F4 Discovery board. To observe their output, you can for example use "debug on board" from GPS and see the printed messages in the st-util window.
